            Week before starting this project, I was scrolling through my old photos. I realized how much of my youth's beauty I had overlooked: the family trips, the natural landscapes, and the serene moments that I had taken for granted. My childhood was a time of boundless freedom, yet I hadn't fully cherished those moments.

The idea of placing my newer memories into a time capsule became a captivating thought, a way to see the growth in the world I've traversed and the places that have touched my soul.
